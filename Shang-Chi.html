            <p class="text">The much-awaited Shangi Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings released today in theatres. It follows the journey of Shang Chi (Simu Liu), the son of the famed MCU villain the Mandarin, who revolts against his father to fight evil. The first
                stand-alone film featuring an Asian American superhero, Shang Chi understandably stands out with its close combat sequences.</p>

            <p class="text">All the actors and especially Simu Liu have undergone extensive martial arts training and it shows, with a sensational sequence on a moving bus in San Francisco and another on a bamboo scaffolding in Macau, the standouts. Awkwafina and a surprise
                returning character from the MCU provide genuine, sarcasm-laced comedy that adds another wonderful layer to the experience. Cameos from Benedict Wong and Ronnie Chieng also manage to leave the audience in spits. Without stooping to cultural
                appropriation, with an all-Asian crew, director Destin Daniel Cretton pays rich tribute to Chinese heritage at every turn. Hong Kong’s superstars Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh are electric in their roles and the fact that they don’t seem
                to have lost a step with age, acing their action sequences, shows their dedication as performers. Regarded as one of the finest actor's Chinese cinema has every produced, Tony Leung stamps his class all over the film, giving an engrossing,
                captivating performance as the dreaded leader of the Ten Rings. His inner moral dilemmas and love/hate relationship with his children are portrayed brilliantly by the man nicknamed ‘Small Tiger’ among the Five Tiger Generals of Hong Kong
                Cinema The flashback sequences help to build up Shang Chi as a character and intricately captures his upbringing as the heir-apparent to a genocidal megalomaniac, and how despite wanting nothing to do with his father’s murderous tendencies,
                as his son, he is inadvertently drawn to the Mandarin’s world of violence and carnage. The films delves into mystical elements towards the climax and with two surprise-laden post-credit sequences tie into both Doctor Strange’s world of
                Mystic Arts as well as a possible connection that the Ten Rings has to alien technology. As always, the way weaves in each individual fim character to the wonderful tapestry that makes up each of its Phases is a joy in itself. It is due
                to the well-written characters and the nuanced acting of its performers that Shang Chi stands out while the eye-catching CGI and elaborately chorographer action sequences add more gloss to the end product. Another wonderful new addition
                to the MCU world and hopefully this paves the way for more ethnicities being represented in the universe as time goes on. Highly recommended. A must watch. Marvel's Phase 4 continues to raise the bar!</p>
